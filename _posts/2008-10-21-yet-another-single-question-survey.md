Most of the time there will be only one question you have to answer but perhaps I will make a bigger survey every now and then. The survey is available for one month and with the new survey released I will publish the results of the last month. Perhaps I will make a new survey every 14 days, but we will see how many answers I can get with this experiment. :-)</p>  <p>I am interested in your thoughts on this subject and if you have own suggestions for a survey you can simply write a e-mail or a comment to this posting.</p>  <p><strong>October-Survey</strong>: <a title="" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=T948k80G9sL_2bOH4Bj5SMlg_3d_3d" target="_blank">What source code repositories do you use?</a></p>
