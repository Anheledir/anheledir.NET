## About

Hi folks!

My name is Gordon Breuer and I’m currently working as a Senior IT Consultant and Software Engineer for [msg systems AG].
I’m mostly developing within the Microsoft Technology Stack, e.g. the [.NET-Framework], Windows Universal Platform, [Windows Azure Cloud] and [Office365]. Also I’m interested in Game Developing with [Unity3D] and Cross-Platfrom Development with [Xamarin]. My preferred programming languages are C# and WPF / XAML, but I’m also fluently writing HTML5 with CSS3 and (not yet so fluently :wink:) JavaScript. There are a lot of other languagues I tried at least, working in IT as a developer for over 15 years had left it’s mark.

Although I started my interest in Computers with eight years, when I was allowed to use my fathers IBM XT 8086 for the first time and started to create my first programs in Basic, I didn’t start a career in IT at first. In fact I started 2003 studying jurisprudence for six semester, but snapped it 2006 as it turns out it just wasn’t the kind of thing I wanted to do the rest of my life. Later, during working in a cross-media marketing agency, I finished my training as a Digital Media Designer, special field Media Operation non-print, with distinction 2009. That makes me a career changer regarding IT, but also giving me some unique insights and expert knowledge most developers cannot keep up with. I also took some further education during my work at [msg systems AG] and finished my training as an IT Architect 2013.

In my free time, when not working on privat projects (APPs, Augmented Reality, IoT / Rasperry Pi, Conference-Speaker, Author, &hellip;), I like to read some old-fashioned book (it just smells better than a tablet!), listing to audio books (loving Agatha Christie and Dan Brown) or some cabaret (if you speak German, I strongly recommend [Volker Pispers] to you!), or I’m listing or even playing music. When I was a child I was sent to music school for nearly 12 years (didn’t liked it very much back then, but now I’m really glad for it) and learned to play the organ. Today I’m playing most of the time only on a keyboard, an organ or a piano is just too big and bulky. I’m also I great fan of board and card games, and I like to create some light sfx videos / movie editing.
